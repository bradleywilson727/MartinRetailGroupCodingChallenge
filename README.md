I created a Customer class and established the parameters for Name, Email Address, and Message. 

Then I created a List in a Customer Controller class to act as a dummy database.

Next, I established a GetCustomers method to allow myself to display the two existing customers I plugged into the 
List and to serve as a confirmation for all future entries.

I then designed the table in the Customer Portal page as the platform to house all the information and 
components used in the project.

Next, I built the ICustomerServices interface in the Services folder and made a Customer Services class that 
inherits from the interface to act as the Web API to communicate between the client and the server. 

Lastly, I created a Create Customer class in the Shared folder which I then inserted into the Customer Portal to allow 
for customer creation. I designed it so that the page refreshed upon submission and showed the updated table to 
confirm that the submission was successful. The table stays updated and shows all submissions until the program 
is closed.



I spent the first day just navigating through the Blazor Web Assembly and tinkering with things to see how they worked.
I consulted many websites and YouTube videos on various aspects of Blazor assembly and function.
I did the vast majority of the construction on the second day, consulting various articles and videos throughout the 
process.



The entire encounter was challenging, honestly. Blazor was not an assembly I was familiar with although it does share
many similarities with ASP.NET. Having just graduated my boot camp yesterday, I am pretty proud of the way I performed.
I feel like my research was effective and I gained an immense amount of knowledge and experience throughout the process.

Thank you, so much, for allowing me this opportunity. I am greatly appreciative that I'm even being considered for this position.
